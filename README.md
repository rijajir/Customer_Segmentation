**Business Context:**

In today's fiercely competitive e-commerce landscape, Thames E-Commerce faces the critical challenge of understanding customer behavior and optimizing marketing strategies. These insights can empower the company to make more informed decisions, improve operational efficiency, and elevate overall business performance.

**Data Source:**

This project leverages the rich dataset "E-Commerce Data | Actual transactions from UK retailer" available on Kaggle. This dataset offers a comprehensive record of transactions from a UK-based online retailer [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data/data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data/data).

This is a trans-national data set that contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 (yearly transaction) for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail, Thames E-Commerce.

The dataset contains 541909 rows and 8 columns which are:

  * **`InvoiceNo`   :** Categorical, Invoice of transactions in unique code.
  * **`StockCode`   :** Categorical, Specific product with unique code.
  * **`Description` :** Categorical, Description of detailed product information.
  * **`Quantity`    :** Numerical, Amount of units had been sold.

Clusters breakdown and their potential customer segments based on percentiles to rank the customers from the RFM metrics to identify behavior patterns:

![Cluster Table](images/cluster_table.png)

**There are 4 clusters of customers based on RFM/purchased behavior:**

---

**Cluster 0: High recency, moderate frequency, moderate monetary**
  * `Distribution (45.57%):` Dominant cluster with 1.660 customers.
  * `Recency (around 30%):` Customers who had made purchases very recently.
  * `Frequency (above 50%):` Their purchase frequency is moderate.
  * `Monetary (around 50%):` They spend a good amount of money.

Cluster 0 represents the `Loyal Customers`. They purchased it recently and spent a good amount of money.

**Cluster 1: Low recency, moderate frequency, moderate monetary**
  * `Distribution (17.10%):` 623 customers.
  * `Recency (around 70%):` They had not made purchase slightly in a long time.
  * `Frequency (above 50%)`: Their purchase frequency is moderate too.
  * `Monetary (around 50%)`: They spend a moderate amount of money.

It represents the `Promising Customers`. These customers have a history of purchases but haven't bought recently

---

**Cluster 2: High recency, high frequency, high monetary**
  * `Distribution (22.34%):` 814 customers.
  * `Recency (around 20%):` These customers have purchased very recently.
  * `Frequency (above 80%):` They purchase very frequently.
  * `Monetary (above 80%):` They spend a significant high amount of money.

Yeay, Cluster 2 represents the best customers, our `Champions`, they are the company's most valuable assets. They purchase frequently, spend a lot of money, and have made purchases very recently.

---

**Cluster 3: Low recency, low frequency, low monetary**
  * `Distribution (14.99%):` The minority of the cluster, with 546 customers.
  * `Recency (above 90%):` Customers who hadn't made purchase in a long time.
  * `Frequency (below 30%):` Their purchase frequency is low, only 1 order on average.
  * `Monetary (around 30%):` They spend a small amount of money.

Very clear, it represents the `At-Risk/Lost Customers`. They haven't purchased recently and might be churned.
